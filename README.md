# Machine Learning for Causal Inference
## Estimating Heterogeneous Treatment Effects with Causal Forests

### Strong Treatment Effect Heterogeneity

These simulations are to explore the ability of Causal Forests to detect treatment effect heterogeneity. In my thesis, this corresponds to the simulations on data drawn according to Design 1 and the results are presented in Table 1 as well as Figures 3,4,5.
